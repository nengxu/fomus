TODO LIST

Immediate:

    Bugs:
      Double brackets shouldn't appear in the same place (6 violins example)
      Send list of XML issues to Sibelius/Finale tech. support
      In CLISP/Cygwin output from executables isn't suppressed (fixable?)
    Documentation:
      Separate MIDI files for different parts
      Proofreading
      More examples (eventually indexed and covering most/all features)
    Backends:
      MusicXML invisible rests (possible?)
      CMN grace notes preceding rests
      CMN tremolos
      CMN cautionary accidentals on chords
      CMN part groups/brackets
      LilyPond not tying repeated notes in chords where other notes are tied (fixable?)
      MIDI output testing/adjusting/fine tuning
    Improvements:
      Allow forcing of staff choices (individual notes and entire voice)
      Improve staff and clef decisions
      More control over harmonics
      More speed improvements (slower in OpenMCL?)
    Additions:
      Dynamic markings fixer (eliminate repeats)
      Specifying percussion from MIDI info
      Automatic percussion instrument changes
      Splitting chords across staves
      Presets for customizing auto-algorithms
      Some more marks:
        pedal on/off
        double/triple tongue
        bartok pizz.
      Number of lines in staff (single-line for percussion)

Short Term:

    Ornaments with accidentals greater than a whole/half step
    Combine separate sections with different settings into one score
    Proportional notation
    Durations that fill to next/previous note
    Part properties: override settings for individual parts
    Support for polymeters in backends
    Key signatures (plus key detection algorithm?)
    "Plug-in" architecture to allow easy extension of functionality

Long Term:

    Fractional meters and tuplets
