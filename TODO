TODO LIST

Immediate:

    Bugs:
      Weird beams in compound meters (caused by some grouping into 4?)
      Finish chunks support
      Finish key signatures support
      Double brackets shouldn't appear in the same place (6 violins example)
      Send list of XML issues to Sibelius/Finale tech. support
      In CLISP/Cygwin output from executables isn't suppressed (fixable?)
    Documentation:
      OFF tags in .fms file
      Specifying chords
      AUTO-DYN-NODUP setting
      Plugin interface
      Separate MIDI files for different parts
      Proofreading
      More examples (eventually indexed and covering most/all features)
    Backends:
      MusicXML invisible rests (possible?)
      CMN grace notes preceding rests
      CMN tremolos
      CMN cautionary accidentals on chords
      CMN part groups/brackets
      LilyPond not tying repeated notes in chords where other notes are tied (fixable in next LilyPond version)
      MIDI output testing/adjusting/fine tuning
    Improvements:
      Finish implementing :invisible mark
      Allow forcing of staff choices (individual notes and entire voice)
      Improve staff and clef decisions
      More control over harmonics
      More speed improvements (why is it 10x slower in OpenMCL?)
      Quantization plugins
    Additions:
      Onset-to-onset durations
      Dynamic markings fixer (eliminate repeats)
      Specifying percussion from MIDI info
      Automatic percussion instrument changes
      Splitting chords across staves
      Presets for customizing auto-algorithms
      Some more marks:
        pedal on/off
        double/triple tongue
        bartok pizz.
      Number of lines in staff (single-line for percussion)

Short Term:

    Ornaments with accidentals greater than a whole/half step
    Proportional notation
    Support for polymeters in backends

Long Term:

    Fractional meters and tuplets
